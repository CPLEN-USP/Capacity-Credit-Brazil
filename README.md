# Capacity Credit Brazil

<!-- badges: start -->

This repository combine functions developed by CPLEN with available functions in REPRA (NREL) package to make possible calculate capacity value and capacity credit for wind and solar resources in the Brazilian system. 

REPRA package was developed by NREL and it is available at  https://github.com/NREL/repra/blob/master/README.md. Although enormously useful, REPRA has some limitations such as maitenance lack and the focus on thermal systems. We have devloped this repository to overcome these limitaions and extend the oriented REPRA development to hydro systems.

The main difference between predominantly hydro systems from thermal ones are the variable capacity of hydro systems. This requires that to calculate capacity contribution from variable sources we are able to update not only load and variable source production but also avaliable capacity from the dispatchable sources.
